        </h1>
        <p>The Internet is one of the most valuble contributions that the study of Computer Science has brought to society. There are many invaluble apllications of the internet which improve the lives of billions around the world every single day.</p>

        <h2>

            <a id = Education></a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            A good freely available education is taken for granted in many countries. There are countries around the world such as Niger where only 17% of girls aged 15-24 are literate or Liberia where 2/3 of primary school children drop of out school. The Internet allows anyone to get access to any information they wish to find. There are websites such as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target = "_blank">Wikipedia</a> which is a very reliable free source of information which allow anyone to learn easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Internet also creates opportunites to gain a full education without having to physically go to school for example the <a href =  "https://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University.</a> There are thousands of paid courses which allow anyone at any age to get qualifications.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Communication
            <a id = Communication></a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Origianlly the Internet was only used by Universities to share data and findings. Now anyone can use the Internet to communicate with people from any country and timezone around the world. This is still very useful for sharing information but also useful for families and friends to stay connected when they do not live close to eachother.
        </p>
        <p>
            Websistes such as Facebook and Twitter allow people to message eachother for free and share other content such as images, videos and GIFs. E-mail is proably the msot common way people communicate over the internet. 306 billion E-mails are sent around the world daily. The internet allows businessess to negotiate without ever having to meet in person wich saves a lot of time.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Community
            <a id = Community></a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The internet enables communities of like-minded people from around the world to connect and shared their interests. This is particularly useful for people who have niche interets that cannot usually share their passion with others. The Internet has so many users that there is bound to be another person that shares your passion.
