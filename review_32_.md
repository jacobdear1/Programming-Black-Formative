# WEBSITE REVIEW:

## Interest of content:
**Excellent**
I like the choice of content; varied articles and topics.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
**Weak**
One page contains 2 headings and navbars. Some pages have images included and some don't 
and there are inconsistencies in the layout and formatting of text and images on and between pages.

## Quality of written presentation:
**Very Good**
Good presentation of text and layout/blocking, just slightly inconsistent font formatting and size. 

## Validity of HTML:
**Weak**
Many HTML errors like missing closing tags, missing braces on the end of tags, duplicate references and
(github merge?) text left in, see:
<<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>> aa215c95814795d931473b2372604b0694f66c9a

## Evidence of Collaboration:
**Outstanding**
Consistent commits with a balanced contribution. Commits are spaced out and not all done at last minute. 
Only problem - not published as a git page.
