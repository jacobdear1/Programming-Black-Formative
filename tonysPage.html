              <p>Social media has became the easiest and most commonly used method of communication online allowing individuals from across the globe to talk communicate with eachother. But where did this all begin?</p>
              <p>In the 1940s, development began on networks that would allow computers to communicate with one another. By the 1980s, the internet was born! </p><p> Find out more by checking out the following page: <a href="#">The Internet</a>.<br></p>

          <h3 class="display-5">Social Impact</h3>
          <p>Below I have included a list of examples showcasing the positive impact social media has had on society:</p>
          <dl class="row">

              <dt class="col-sm-3">Communication</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-9">Social media allows family and friends to communicate with one another regardless of their location.</dd>

              <dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Promote causes</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-9">Users are able to share information about worthwhile causes such as charities. This can help raise awareness about issues across the globe that others may not be aware of. The black lives matter movement in 2021 was a great example of how technology could be used to spread a message and gain support.</dd>

              <dt class="col-sm-3">Finding an outlet</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-9">Social media provides a great place for people to share content they have created. It is so wide spread that you are always able to connect with a like minded person, making it a great place to share your interests and perhaps gain a following. Content creators can use this tool to make a living while hobbyists can learn from one another. This makes social media a great tool for exploring hobbies and finding a creative outlet.</dd>
