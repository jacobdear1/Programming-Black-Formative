      <h3>Why we Predict the Weather</h3>
      <p>
        Computers have been predicting the weather with some level of success since the 1950s - This is known as numerical weather prediction.
        Since then, numerical weather prediction continues to become more accurate as we use more advanced technology.
        Knowing when and where a natural disaster will hit has helped mitigate many hurricanes such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Hurricane Rita (2005)</li>
          <li>Hurricane Gustav (2008)</li>
          <li>Hurricane Ike (2008)</li>
          <li>Hurricane Harvey (2017)</li>
        </ul>
        Amoung <a href = "https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disaster/2021-atlantic-hurricane-season/">many others</a>. 
        By predicting the nature of these hurricanes before they hit, appropriate measures can be taken to prevent potential catastrophes.
        When authorities have time to react to a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, they can better prepare for the consequences.

      <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>

          <p>
            Artifical intelligence (AI) is a method of solving problems by analysing a large set of data, although there's 
            <a href = "https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/artificial-intelligence/">more to it</a> than that.
            Increasingly, AI is playing a major role in monitoring the weather. Since we now have so much data on different natural disasters, it is an ideal problem for AI to solve.
            AI works by analysing many variables in the climate and uses that information to predict how the weather will change.
            Historically, earthquakes have been difficult to predict due to their seemingly random nature. However, scientists have collected accurate data of over 130,000 earthquakes and the subsequent aftershocks.
            Modern AI has been able to analyse this data and predict the locations of aftershocks more successfully than any other method.
