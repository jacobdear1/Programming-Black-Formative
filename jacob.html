              <p class="card-text">The first X-ray machine was invented by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. Which had many parts and was complicated to reproduce.
                  However, due to innovation and the development of computing, modern X-ray machines are much simpler to make.<br>
                  They are pivotal to identifying anything wrong with the body, as the x-ray is the earliest form of medical imaging and remains quite in demand. It makes use of electromagnetic waves to produce pictures of the body’s internal organs. An x-ray shows doctors images of your internal structures in shades of black and white.<br>
                  Some of the key uses of X-rays are below:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Bone fractures or abnormalities.</li>
                      <li>Foreign objects in the body.</li>
                      <li>Some tumors, such as those in the lungs.</li>
                      <li>Other lung diseases, such as pneumonia.</li>
                  </ul>

              <h5 class="card-title">3. Vaccine Development</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Vaccine development has traditionally been a process measured in years and even decades as scientists tinker with a pathogen trying to weaken or dissemble it to render it capable of creating an effective immune response with acceptable levels of side effects.
                  However, in 2020, powerful new vaccine technologies are available to augment traditional vaccine development and are responsible for the rapid delivery of a vaccine candidate for the start of clinical trials.
                  The new technologies that are being harnessed are what are known as vaccine platform technologies. <br>
                  A Vaccine platform confers the ability to switch out the pathogen being targeted very rapidly.
                  Because of this rapid availability to utilize platforms for a variety of different targets, the initial development process can be significantly shortened. This is especially true for vaccines utilizing the genetic material of the target alone.
                  These DNA and RNA vaccines basically can be "printed" once the genetic sequence of the target is known.
                  Because of these leaps in technology in repsonse to the development of a Coronavirus Vaccine, an RNA vaccine is the approach being used by the Cambridge-based biotech company Moderna – which took just 42 days to produce an experimental vaccine candidate.

              <p class="card-text">Wearable Technology, such as Fitbits and smartwatches, have become mainstream devices.
                  These can be stylish as well as being practical, and they help people to track their activities, such as runs and rowing, which can be linked back to their phones.
                  Also, most smartwatches have heart rate monitors that can help give medical professionals data about you when you are exercising. This can help diagnose dieases / heart problems early
                  Wearable technology promotes behavior that reduces hospital visits and readmissions due to poorly managed personal health – 75% of users agree that wearables help them engage with their own health.<br>
                  Wearable ECG monitors are on the cutting edge of consumer electronics, and what sets these monitors apart from some smartwatches, is their ability to measure electrocardiograms, or ECGs.<br>
                  Omron Healthcare launched <a href="https://omronhealthcare.com/products/heartguide-wearable-blood-pressure-monitor-bp8000m/?utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliate&cjevent=d556b2573cf911ec828900e20a180514" target ="blank"> HeartGuide </a>in 2019, the first wearable blood pressure monitor. Though it might look like a typical smartwatch, HeartGuide is an oscillometric blood pressure monitor that can measure blood pressure and daily activity – like steps taken, distance traveled, and calories burned.
